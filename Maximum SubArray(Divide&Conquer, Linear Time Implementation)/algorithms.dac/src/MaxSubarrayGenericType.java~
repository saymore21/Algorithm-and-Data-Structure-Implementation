 The goal of the programming task is to practice the divide-and-conquer technique and review the time complexity analysis of recurrences.

Please develop a divide-and-conquer solution of determining a maximum sum of certain subsets of one-dimensional arrays in the running time of O(n lg n). Please also perform the time complexity analysis.

Problem Statement
Maximum Subsequence Sum problem (also called maximum subarrays problem): given an array A with signed integer elements, find a contiguous subarray with a maximum possible sum. 

Finding the Maximum Subsequence Sum

Given an array A of signed integers, design an algorithm that finds a subarray A[i, …, j] such that
A[i ] + A[i + 1] + … + A[j] is maximum in time O(n log n). More specifically, find a pair (i, j) such thatⱯ(x,y) ∑k=i j A[k] > ∑k’=i j A[k’]  .

The intuitive method is to scan all pairs, A[i] and A[j], sum up all elements from A[i] through A[j], and find a maximum sum. However, the solution takes the running time of O( n2 ) . 



To obtain a running time of O(n log n), we can apply the divide-and-conquer method. 

Note the following properties of the Maximum Subsequence Sum (MSS). First, if the array elements are all nonnegative, then the MSS is given by the sum from i = 1 to j = n. Second, if A[i ] < 0 Ɐi, then the MSS can be defined as the element closest to zero. Note that, by definition, we disallow the empty set as a valid input (or solution to) the Maximum Subsequence Sum problem. In addition, note that the MSS is not necessarily unique; there could be more than one subarray which achieves the maximum sum.

Let’s split the sequence in half, recursively solve the problem on both halves and see what we can do. 
The maximum may appear from the left half, right half, or a consecutive subsequence across the element in the middle. As for the last one, we can scan the left subsequence and right subsequence in order to find a left start which gives a maximum sub-sum in the left subsequence, ending in the middle element of the whole sequence, and find a right end which gives a maximum sub-sum in the right subsequence, starting from the middle element of the whole sequence. The procedure can be recursively carried out till the base case (only one element is left in each subsequence.

Divide-and-Conquer in details: 
Generic problem: Find a maximum subarray of A[low...high]
Initial call: low = 1 and high = n
Divide-and-conquer strategy:
1) Divide: A[low...high] into two subarrays of as equal size as possible by
finding the midpoint mid
2) Conquer:
(a) finding maximum subarrays of A[low...mid] and A[mid + 1...high]
(b) finding a max-subarray that crosses the midpoint
3) Combine: returning the max of the three
